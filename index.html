            <span class="post-date">19 Apr 2024</span>
            <p class="post-description">In between TikTok diet trends such as the hot pickle challenge and cottage cheese, a new and even more insufferable trend has emerged: 'Oatzempic'.

                While the name may be a stroke of genius (oats and weight loss drugs, but make it TikTok), the actual diet is far from it. Undeterred, many influencers are promising that this liquid meal is a potent weight loss supplement, with some users claiming it can help elicit as much as 40lbs of weight loss in as little as two months.</p>

            <p class="post-description">Eat, sleep, curl, repeat. While we often advocate full-body compound moves such as the deadlift when it comes to functional muscle building, sometimes you just can't beat a good old-fashioned pump-sesh. But we're betting the bent-over rows, skullcrushers and endless curling are getting a little stale?.</p>
